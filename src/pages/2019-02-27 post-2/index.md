Hi everyone,

I wanted to release a quick blog about my first Youtube video and how this came about. So here is the quick version:

As I mentioned in the first blog, I wanted to solidify my knowledge by teaching about what I'm learning. I believe it strengthens the understanding and it allows for feedback on something I might be missing or misunderstanding.

First off, coming from a background with little to no coding experience, then teaching yourself coding and then taking that knowledge, recordig it and putting it on Youtbe for all to see and judge is extrememly nerve racking. Which I'm pretty sure led to numerous messups while filming. 

Someone told me, you don't always learn while being comfortable. Often times the best learning will come from when you are out of your element and uncomfortable. So I became very uncomfortable and released the video. If you like you can check it out **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brw5s5dhM7o&t=5s).**

Thanks again for stopping by and taking the time to read.
