Hi everyone,

Welocome to my first blog. I'm pretty excited to start this new journey. In this first post, I just wanted to address some things. If you would like to read a full intro of who I am, you can look in the About section. So what is this blog about? This blog is a journey on my path to become a Software Developer. I wnated to document this journey for a couple of reasons. 

1. To see my progress and how far I've come.
2. To hopefully inspire others like so many have inspired me.

I also wanted to mention my YouTube channel where I plan to cover various software/coding topics. As I learn, I would to teach and share my process. They say the best way to solidify your learning is to teach and share. It allows growth and room for feedback. 

Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read.
