Hi everyone,

I thought I would take some time to talk about a mistake or just a plain messup that I made while building a recent React application. This took me a whole day and yes I can admit this because I'm human and learning. 

I've had my share of spelling mistakes, it happens. Your excited, your feeling the adrenaline, the rush of coding and yoour typing fast without looking up and your code doesn't work. But with some careful inspection, your able to spot it and make a correction.

This was not that mistake. I don't believe I've actually made this type of mistake before which was why it was SO frustrating but completely rewarding to figure out on my own. When your following along with a tutorial, your following someone else's code. Its laid out for you so mistakes aren't that likely to happen. Writing your own code, getting your hands dirty is a much better learning experience because your sort of taking off the trainging wheels.

The mistake you may be asking: I was using a variable in my code before I declared it. Lesson learned.

Thanks for stpping by and taking the time to read. Til next time.
