        <h1>A little bit about me...</h1>
        <p>Greetings, I am Melveta Atkinson.</p>
         <p>I am a passionate, forward thinking Software Developer. I started my journey into software development like many with a curosity in technology and this led me to programming and fell head over heals in love with it. I've taken this love and applied it to blogging, creating tutorials on YouTube, creating my own apps and tutoring college students.</p>
        
        <p>My primary focus is Front End technologies centering around React JS but I am always pushing myself to learn new and exciting technologies in web development. Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to get to know a little more about me and feel free to read any of the blogs I have posted or check out my Youtube channel.</p>
